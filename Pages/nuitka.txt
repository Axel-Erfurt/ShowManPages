Usage: nuitka [--module] [--execute] [options] main_module.py

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --module              Create an extension module executable instead of a
                        program. Defaults to off.
  --standalone, --portable
                        Enable standalone mode in build. This allows you to
                        transfer the created binary to other machines without
                        it relying on an existing Python installation. It
                        implies these option: "--recurse-all". You may also
                        want to use "--python-flag=no_site" to avoid the
                        "site.py" module, which can save a lot of code
                        dependencies. Defaults to off.
  --nofreeze-stdlib     In standalone mode by default all modules of standard
                        library will be frozen as bytecode. This compiles them
                        all and as a result compilation time will increase
                        very much.
  --python-version=PYTHON_VERSION
                        Major version of Python to be used, one of '2.6',
                        '2.7', '3.2', '3.3', '3.4', '3.5', or '3.6'. Defaults
                        to what you run Nuitka with (currently 2.7)
  --python-debug, --python-dbg
                        Use debug version or not. Default uses what you are
                        using to run Nuitka, most likely a non-debug version.
  --python-flag=PYTHON_FLAGS
                        Python flags to use. Default uses what you are using
                        to run Nuitka, this enforces a specific mode. These
                        are options that also exist to standard Python
                        executable. Currently supported: "-S" (alias
                        "nosite"), "static_hashes" (not use hash
                        randomization), "no_warnings" (do not give Python
                        runtime warnings), "-O" (alias "noasserts"). Default
                        empty.
  --python-for-scons=PYTHON_SCONS, --python2-for-scons=PYTHON_SCONS
                        If using Python3.2 to Python3.4, provide the path of a
                        Python binary to use for Scons. Otherwise Nuitka can
                        use what you run Nuitka with or a "scons" binary that
                        is found in PATH, or a Python installation from
                        Windows registry.
  --warn-implicit-exceptions
                        Enable warnings for implicit exceptions detected at
                        compile time.
  --warn-unusual-code   Enable warnings for unusual code detected at compile
                        time.

  Control the recursion into imported modules:
    --recurse-stdlib    Also descend into imported modules from standard
                        library. Defaults to off.
    --recurse-none      When --recurse-none is used, do not descend into any
                        imported modules at all, overrides all other recursion
                        options. Defaults to off.
    --recurse-all, --recurse-on
                        When --recurse-all is used, attempt to descend into
                        all imported modules. Defaults to off.
    --recurse-to=MODULE/PACKAGE
                        Recurse to that module, or if a package, to the whole
                        package. Can be given multiple times. Default empty.
    --recurse-not-to=MODULE/PACKAGE
                        Do not recurse to that module, or if a package, to the
                        whole package in any case, overrides all other
                        options. Can be given multiple times. Default empty.
    --recurse-plugins=MODULE/PACKAGE, --recurse-directory=MODULE/PACKAGE
                        Recurse into that directory, no matter if it's used by
                        the given main program in a visible form. Overrides
                        all other recursion options. Can be given multiple
                        times. Default empty.
    --recurse-files=PATTERN, --recurse-pattern=PATTERN
                        Recurse into files matching the PATTERN. Overrides all
                        recursion other options. Can be given multiple times.
                        Default empty.

  Immediate execution after compilation:
    --run, --execute    Execute immediately the created binary (or import the
                        compiled module). Defaults to off.
    --debugger, --gdb   Execute inside "gdb" to automatically get a stack
                        trace. Defaults to off.
    --execute-with-pythonpath, --keep-pythonpath
                        When immediately executing the created binary
                        (--execute), don't reset PYTHONPATH. When all modules
                        are successfully included, you ought to not need
                        PYTHONPATH anymore.

  Dump options for internal tree:
    --dump-xml, --xml   Dump the final result of optimization as XML, then
                        exit.
    --display-tree      Display the final result of optimization in a GUI,
                        then exit.

  Code generation choices:
    --full-compat       Enforce absolute compatibility with CPython. Do not
                        even allow minor deviations from CPython behavior,
                        e.g. better tracebacks, which are not really
                        incompatible, but different. This is intended for
                        tests only and should not be necessary for normal use.
    --file-reference-choice=FILE_REFERENCE_MODE
                        Select what value "__file__" is going to be. With
                        "runtime" (default for standalone binary mode and
                        module mode), the created binaries and modules, use
                        the location of themselves to deduct the value of
                        "__file__". Included packages pretend to be in
                        directories below that location. This allows you to
                        include data files in deployments. If you merely seek
                        acceleration, it's better for you to use the
                        "original" value, where the source files location will
                        be used. With "frozen" a notation "<frozen
                        module_name>" is used. For compatibility reasons, the
                        "__file__" value will always have ".py" suffix
                        independent of what it really is.

  Output choices:
    --output-dir=DIRECTORY
                        Specify where intermediate and final output files
                        should be put. The DIRECTORY will be populated with C
                        files, object files, etc. Defaults to current
                        directory.
    --remove-output     Removes the build directory after producing the module
                        or exe file. Defaults to off.
    --no-pyi-file       Do not create a ".pyi" file for extension modules
                        created by Nuitka. Defaults to off.

  Debug features:
    --debug             Executing all self checks possible to find errors in
                        Nuitka, do not use for production. Defaults to off.
    --unstripped, --no-strip, --unstriped
                        Keep debug info in the resulting object file for
                        better debugger interaction. Defaults to off.
    --profile           Enable vmprof based profiling of time spent. Defaults
                        to off.
    --graph             Create graph of optimization process. Defaults to off.
    --trace-execution   Traced execution output, output the line of code
                        before executing it. Defaults to off.
    --recompile-c-only, --recompile-c++-only
                        Take existing files and compile them again. Allows
                        compiling edited C files with the C compiler for quick
                        debugging changes to the generated source. Defaults to
                        off. Depends on compiling Python source to determine
                        which files it should look at.
    --generate-c-only   Generate only C source code, and do not compile it to
                        binary or module. This is for debugging and code
                        coverage analysis that doesn't waste CPU. Defaults to
                        off.
    --experimental=EXPERIMENTAL
                        Use features declared as 'experimental'. May have no
                        effect if no experimental features are present in the
                        code. Uses secret tags (check source) per experimented
                        feature.

  Backend C compiler choice:
    --clang             Enforce the use of clang (needs clang 3.2 or higher).
                        Defaults to off.
    --mingw             Enforce the use of MinGW on Windows. Defaults to off.
    --msvc=MSVC         Enforce the use of specific MSVC version on Windows.
                        Allowed values are e.g. 9.0, 9.0exp, specify an
                        illegal value for a list of installed compilers.
                        Defaults to the most recent version.
    -j N, --jobs=N      Specify the allowed number of parallel C compiler
                        jobs. Defaults to the system CPU count.
    --lto               Use link time optimizations if available and usable
                        (g++ 4.6 and higher). Defaults to off.

  Tracing features:
    --show-scons        Operate Scons in non-quiet mode, showing the executed
                        commands. Defaults to off.
    --show-progress     Provide progress information and statistics. Defaults
                        to off.
    --show-memory       Provide memory information and statistics. Defaults to
                        off.
    --show-modules      Provide a final summary on included modules. Defaults
                        to off.
    --verbose           Output details of actions taken, esp. in
                        optimizations. Can become a lot. Defaults to off.

  Windows specific output control:
    --windows-disable-console
                        When compiling for Windows, disable the console
                        window. Defaults to off.
    --windows-icon=ICON_PATH, --icon=ICON_PATH
                        Add executable icon (Windows only).

  Plugin control:
    --plugin-enable=PLUGINS_ENABLED, --enable-plugin=PLUGINS_ENABLED
                        Enabled plugins. Must be plug-in names. Use --plugin-
                        list to query the full list and exit. Default empty.
    --plugin-disable=PLUGINS_DISABLED, --disable-plugin=PLUGINS_DISABLED
                        Disabled plugins. Must be plug-in names. Use --plugin-
                        list to query the full list and exit. Default empty.
    --plugin-no-detection
                        Plugins can detect if they might be used, and the you
                        can disable the warning via --plugin-disable=plugin-
                        that-warned, or you can use this option to disable the
                        mechanism entirely, which also speeds up compilation
                        slightly of course as this detection code is run in
                        vain once you are certain of which plug-ins to use.
                        Defaults to off.
    --plugin-list       Show list of all available plugins and exit. Defaults
                        to off.
